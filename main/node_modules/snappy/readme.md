# snappy [![Linux Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/kesla/node-snappy.svg?label=linux)](https://travis-ci.org/kesla/node-snappy)

Nodejs bindings to the [snappy](https://github.com/google/snappy) compression library

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/snappy.png?downloads&stars)](https://nodei.co/npm/snappy/)

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm-dl/snappy.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/snappy/)


## Installation

```bash
npm install snappy
```

## Example

### Input

```javascript
var snappy = require('snappy')

snappy.compress('beep boop', function (err, compressed) {
  console.log('compressed is a Buffer', compressed)
  // return it as a string
  snappy.uncompress(compressed, { asBuffer: false }, function (err, original) {
    console.log('the original String', original)
  })
})
```

### Output

```bash
compressed is a Buffer <SlowBuffer 09 20 62 65 65 70 20 62 6f 6f 70>
the original String beep boop
```

## API

### snappy.compress(input, callback)

Compress `input`, which can be a `Buffer` or a `String`.

The `callback` function will be called with a single `error` if the operation failed for any reason. If successful the first argument will be `null` and the second argument will be the `value` as a ``Buffer`.

### snappy.compressSync(input)

The synchronous version of `snappy.compress`, returns the compressed value.

### snappy.uncompress(compressed, [options,] callback)

Uncompress `compressed` and call `callback` with `err` and `decompressed`.

#### `options`

* `'asBuffer'` *(boolean, default: `true`)*: Used to determine whether to return the `value` of the entry as a `String` or a Node.js `Buffer` object. Note that converting from a `Buffer` to a `String` incurs a cost so if you need a `String` (and the `value` can legitimately become a UFT8 string) then you should fetch it as one with `asBuffer: true` and you'll avoid this conversion cost.

The `callback` function will be called with a single `error` if the operation failed for any reason. If successful the first argument will be `null` and the second argument will be the `value` as a `String` or `Buffer` depending on the `asBuffer` option.

### snappy.uncompressSync(compressed, [options])

The synchronous version of `snappy.uncompress`, returns the uncompressed value.

### snappy.isValidCompressed(input, callback)

Check is input is a valid compressed `Buffer`.

The `callback` function will be called with a single `error` if the operation failed for any reason and the second argument will be `true` if input is a valid snappy compressed Buffer, `false` otherwise.

### snappy.isValidCompressedSync(input)

The synchronous version of `snappy.isValidCompressed`, returns a boolean indicating if input was correctly compressed or not.

### stream

For a streaming interface to snappy, please take a look at [snappy-stream](https://www.npmjs.org/package/snappy-stream)

## [Benchmark](benchmark)

This is the result I'm seeing on my laptop (Macbook Air from 2012) running `node benchmark`

```bash
  snappy.compress() x 479 ops/sec ±0.99% (80 runs sampled)
  zlib.gzip() x 289 ops/sec ±1.66% (86 runs sampled)
  snappy.uncompress() x 652 ops/sec ±0.86% (43 runs sampled)
  zlib.gunzip() x 559 ops/sec ±1.65% (64 runs sampled)
```
