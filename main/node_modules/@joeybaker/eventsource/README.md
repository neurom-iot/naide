# EventSource [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/joeybaker/eventsource.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/joeybaker/eventsource) [![Dependencies](https://david-dm.org/joeybaker/eventsource.svg)](https://david-dm.org/joeybaker/eventsource)

This library is a pure JavaScript implementation of the [EventSource](http://www.w3.org/TR/eventsource/) client. The API aims to be W3C compatible.

You can use it with Node.js or as a browser polyfill for
[browsers that don't have native `EventSource` support](http://caniuse.com/#search=eventsource).

## This Fork
* Fixes several multiple reconnect issues (these are quite serious)
* Adds a `timeout` option to manually reconnect after a specified time
* Allows disabling the reconnection

## Install

    npm install @joeybaker/eventsource

## Example

    npm install
    node ./example/sse-server.js
    node ./example/sse-client.js    # Node.js client
    open http://localhost:8080      # Browser client - both native and polyfill
    curl http://localhost:8080/sse  # Enjoy the simplicity of SSE)

## Browser Polyfill

Just add `example/eventsource-polyfill.js` file to your web page:

```html
<script src=/eventsource-polyfill.js></script>
```

Now you will have two global constructors:

```javascript
window.EventSourcePolyfill
window.EventSource // Unchanged if browser has defined it. Otherwise, same as window.EventSourcePolyfill
```

If you're using [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) or [browserify](http://browserify.org/)
you can of course build your own. (The `example/eventsource-polyfill.js` is built with webpack).

## Extensions to the W3C API

### Setting HTTP request headers

You can define custom HTTP headers for the initial HTTP request. This can be useful for e.g. sending cookies
or to specify an initial `Last-Event-ID` value.

HTTP headers are defined by assigning a `headers` attribute to the optional `eventSourceInitDict` argument:

```javascript
var eventSourceInitDict = {headers: {'Cookie': 'test=test'}};
var es = new EventSource(url, eventSourceInitDict);
```

### Allow unauthorized HTTPS requests

By default, https requests that cannot be authorized will cause connection to fail and an exception
to be emitted. You can override this behaviour:

```javascript
var eventSourceInitDict = {rejectUnauthorized: false};
var es = new EventSource(url, eventSourceInitDict);
```

Note that for Node.js < v0.10.x this option has no effect - unauthorized HTTPS requests are *always* allowed.

### HTTP status code on error events

Unauthorized and redirect error status codes (for example 401, 403, 301, 307) are available in the `status` property in the error event.

```javascript
es.onerror = function (err) {
  if (err) {
    if (err.status === 401 || err.status === 403) {
      console.log('not authorized');
    }
  }
};
```

### HTTP/HTTPS proxy

You can define a `proxy` option for the HTTP request to be used. This is typically useful if you are behind a corporate firewall.

```javascript
var es = new EventSource(url, { proxy: 'http://your.proxy.com' });
```

### Disable Reconnect
The spec says that `Eventsource` should reconnect when the connection errors. This is typically good behavior, but you might want to turn this off.

```javascript
var es = new EventSource(url, { reconnect: false });
```

### Timeout the Connection
To work around the disadvantages of native `Eventsource`, this module uses XHR long-polling to simulate an `Eventsource` object. This can look like an idle connection to servers which can end the connection. This module will auto-reconnect, but if you'd like to avoid server errors, you can manually re-connect after a specified time.

```javascript
// reconnect after 10 seconds
var es = new EventSource(url, { time: 10000 });
```
