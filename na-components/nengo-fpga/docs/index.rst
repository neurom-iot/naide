NengoFPGA is an extension of :std:doc:`Nengo <nengo:index>`
that allows portions of a network to be run on an FPGA to improve performance
and efficiency.

Currently NengoFPGA supports the Xilinx PYNQ board from Digilent and TUL, and the
Intel Altera DE1 SoC from Terasic. Each has a slightly different implementation
but NengoFPGA provides a unified frontend for both devices.
