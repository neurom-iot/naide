    "Such dynamics are important for memory, noise cleanup, statistical inference, and many\n",
    "other dynamic transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In standard control theoretic form, the dynamics of a state vector can be described as:\n",

    "\\dot{x}(t) = \\mathbf{A}x(t) + \\mathbf{B}u(t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",

    "integrator, $\\mathbf{A} = 0$ and $\\mathbf{B} = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying the dynamics principal of the NEF, for a neural network using exponential\n",
    "synapses (like the FpgaPesEnsembleNetwork network), the feedback and input matrices can\n",

    "When you run this example, it will automatically put in some step functions on the\n",
    "input, so you can see that the output is integrating (i.e. summing over time) the input.\n",
    "You can also input your own values. Note that since the integrator constantly sums its\n",
    "input, it will saturate quickly if you leave the input non-zero. This makes it clear\n",
    "that neurons have a finite range of representation. Such saturation effects can be\n",
